# Walkthrough: Move from ALZ to AWS Control Tower<a name="alz-to-control-tower"></a>

Many AWS customers have adopted the [AWS Landing Zone solution \(ALZ\)](http://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/aws-landing-zone/) to set up a secure, compliant, multi\-account AWS environment\. To reduce the burden of managing a landing zone, AWS created the managed service called AWS Control Tower\.

No additional features are scheduled for ALZ; it is in long\-term support only\. Therefore, we recommend that you move to the AWS Control Tower service from ALZ\. The blog that is linked in this chapter walks you through different considerations for that move, and it explains how you can plan a successful migration from ALZ to AWS Control Tower\.

AWS Prescriptive Guidance offers more extensive documentation, including steps for transitioning from ALZ to AWS Control Tower\. Essentially, you will enable AWS Control Tower governance in your existing organization that is running ALZ, based upon a number of prerequisites\.
